## Improvements 

**Validations** : There is no validation on the server side for fields for inputs. 

**Database design** : Database can be more precise to cover our data in details.

**UI Design** : The design and animation are no reflection of what can be done. If there was more time and defined design, we could have much more to see. 

**Stete management** : It whould be a better choice to use an seperate state management like redux to create a signle sourse for our state.

**Error Handleing** : The app should be tested more thoroughly to find the scenarios that encounter problems.
